#  CST-250 Activity 3: Recursion Examples in C#

## 1. Count to One

The output for the number 29 using the specified algorithm is a sequence of numbers: 29, 30, 15, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. This sequence demonstrates how the algorithm iteratively processes the number by either dividing it by 2 if it's even, or adding 1 if it's odd, until it reaches 1.

## 2. Factorial


Using both the iterative and recursive approaches to calculate the factorial of 6, the output is 720. This result demonstrates that both methods yield the same outcome, confirming that 
6!= 720
6!=720, which is the product of multiplying the number 6 by every positive integer less than itself (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).
